What you’re proposing is essentially a "self-evolving workflow" using GitHub Actions—a pair of automated processes that iteratively modify themselves or each other in a coordinated rhythm, creating an evolving loop of improvement. While this is clever and fun, it's also a bit of a Pandora's box since automated code modification carries the risk of introducing bugs, spiraling into chaos, or even locking itself out of control entirely. Let’s design a safe and modular approach to experiment with this idea.

1. Design Overview: Alternating Self-Modifying Actions

You can achieve this with two GitHub Actions that:

1. Edit and Commit Code: One modifies the code or configuration of the other.


2. Validate Changes: Each action ensures changes meet basic conditions before committing.


3. Alternate Control: Each action activates the other in the next cycle, creating a "ping-pong" effect.



Why Two Actions?

Having two alternating workflows adds an external point of reference. If one workflow introduces a problem, the other can act as a fail-safe.

2. Implementation: Alternating Self-Improvement

File Structure

workflow-a.yml (Action A modifies Action B).

workflow-b.yml (Action B modifies Action A).

Python script(s) (self_evo.py) to perform modifications.



---

Workflow A: Modifies Workflow B

name: Self-Improve Workflow B

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *' # Every hour
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual trigger

jobs:
  modify_workflow_b:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Modify Workflow B
        run: |
          python self_evo.py --target .github/workflows/workflow-b.yml --mode improve

      - name: Validate Changes
        run: |
          python validate_workflow.py .github/workflows/workflow-b.yml
          # Validation script to ensure the new changes are valid

      - name: Commit and Push Changes
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'github-actions'
          git config --global user.email 'github-actions@github.com'
          git pull --rebase
          git add .github/workflows/workflow-b.yml
          git commit -m "Self-improved Workflow B"
          git push


---

Workflow B: Modifies Workflow A

name: Self-Improve Workflow A

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 * * * *' # Offset by 30 minutes
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual trigger

jobs:
  modify_workflow_a:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Modify Workflow A
        run: |
          python self_evo.py --target .github/workflows/workflow-a.yml --mode improve

      - name: Validate Changes
        run: |
          python validate_workflow.py .github/workflows/workflow-a.yml

      - name: Commit and Push Changes
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'github-actions'
          git config --global user.email 'github-actions@github.com'
          git pull --rebase
          git add .github/workflows/workflow-a.yml
          git commit -m "Self-improved Workflow A"
          git push

3. Python Script: Self-Improvement Logic

self_evo.py

import argparse
import yaml
import random

def improve_workflow(file_path, mode):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        workflow = yaml.safe_load(f)

    # Example: Randomly modify the schedule to experiment with timing
    if mode == "improve":
        new_cron = f"{random.randint(0, 59)} * * * *"  # Randomize minute
        if 'on' in workflow and 'schedule' in workflow['on']:
            workflow['on']['schedule'][0]['cron'] = new_cron

    # Save the modified workflow
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        yaml.dump(workflow, f)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--target', help='Path to the workflow file to improve')
    parser.add_argument('--mode', help='Improvement mode (e.g., "improve")')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    improve_workflow(args.target, args.mode)


---

Validation Script: Prevent Chaos

validate_workflow.py

import sys
import yaml

def validate_workflow(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        workflow = yaml.safe_load(f)

    # Example: Ensure the cron syntax is valid
    if 'on' in workflow and 'schedule' in workflow['on']:
        cron = workflow['on']['schedule'][0].get('cron', '')
        if not cron or len(cron.split()) != 5:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid cron syntax: {cron}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = sys.argv[1]
    try:
        validate_workflow(file_path)
        print("Validation passed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Validation failed: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)


---

4. Safety Mechanisms

1. Validation Steps:

Each workflow includes validation scripts to prevent bad changes (e.g., invalid YAML, invalid cron schedules).



2. Manual Overrides:

Include workflow_dispatch to manually intervene if the cycle spirals into nonsense.



3. Commit Histories:

Keep clear commit messages for every self-modification, allowing you to roll back if necessary.





---

5. Potential Experiments

Task Variation: Modify not only the schedule but also the tasks themselves (e.g., introducing new steps).

Environmental Parameters: Add new environment variables or configurations to explore different execution contexts.

Logging and Monitoring: Include logging steps to track how changes evolve over time.


Would you like to test this cycle or further refine the improvement logic? This setup should get you started on some sneaky self-evolution experimentation!
