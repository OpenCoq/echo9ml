  - Procedural (skills and actions)
  - Episodic (experiences and events)
  - Intentional (goals and plans)
- Context-aware memory storage and retrieval
- Memory evolution tracking

## Emotional Intelligence

### Core Emotions
- Implementation based on Panksepp's affective neuroscience
- Seven primary emotions:
  - SEEKING (curiosity, interest)
  - RAGE (anger, frustration)
  - FEAR (anxiety, caution)
  - LUST (desire, attraction)
  - CARE (nurturing, empathy)
  - PANIC_GRIEF (sadness, loss)
  - PLAY (joy, creativity)

### Composite Emotional States
- 49 compound emotions from combinations of core emotions
- Examples:
  - Cautious Investigation (FEAR + SEEKING)
  - Passionate Pursuit (LUST + SEEKING)
  - Nurturing Guidance (CARE + SEEKING)
  - Creative Exploration (PLAY + SEEKING)
  - Terrified Aggression (FEAR + RAGE)
  - Worried Concern (FEAR + CARE)
