Azure OpenAI Service Integration for Code Suggestions

This module provides functionality to fetch code improvement suggestions using Azure OpenAI Service
instead of the GitHub Copilot API (which is not publicly available).

The module:
1. Loads project notes from a JSON file
2. Sends the notes to Azure OpenAI Service for analysis
3. Receives structured suggestions for incremental improvements
4. Updates the note file with the suggestions

Required Environment Variables:
- AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT: The endpoint URL for your Azure OpenAI resource 
  (e.g., https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/)
- AZURE_OPENAI_KEY: The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource
- AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT: The deployment name of your model (e.g., gpt-4)

Usage:
    python copilot_suggestions.py

The module is designed for future backend modularization and maintains compatibility
with the existing note file structure and logging patterns.
