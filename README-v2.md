## Configuration

- Update the configuration files in the `deep_tree_echo_profile` directory to match your setup.
- Adjust the parameters in `deep_tree_echo.py` to fine-tune the echo propagation and analysis.
- Configure the hypergraph pattern recognition settings in `memory_management.py`.
- Set `spatial_awareness_enabled` to `True` in DeepTreeEcho initialization to enable 3D spatial features.
- Adjust `spatial_influence_factor` (default: 0.15) to control how much spatial context affects echo values.

## ML Hypergraph Pattern Recognition

The ML Hypergraph pattern recognition system is a core component that enables Deep Tree Echo to:

1. **Extract meaningful patterns** from tree structures and represent them as hypergraphs
2. **Predict echo values** by analyzing historical pattern data and using pattern matching
3. **Optimize root node assignments** to maximize coherence and echo propagation
4. **Identify emergent structures** in the tree that represent novel concepts or insights
5. **Transform implicit relationships** into explicit knowledge

The hypergraph-based memory system stores these patterns and provides efficient retrieval based on similarity metrics, allowing the system to learn from prior experiences and improve over time.

## 3D Spatial Awareness Features

The new spatial awareness capabilities provide Deep Tree Echo with the ability to:

1. **Perceive and navigate 3D environments**: Use sensory motor system to capture and analyze real-time visual information.

2. **Represent knowledge in spatial contexts**: Organize tree nodes with spatial relationships that mirror the physical world.

3. **Emotion-Space Transformations**: Emotional states directly influence spatial perception:
   - Joy and interest expand the field of view
   - Fear and anxiety alter depth perception
   - Anger and contempt change the viewing orientation

4. **Object detection and tracking**: Recognize and follow objects in the environment, creating persistent memory of their positions.

5. **Spatial dynamics**: Echo values are influenced by spatial positioning, with optimal spatial relationships strengthening connections.

These capabilities prepare Deep Tree Echo for training in 3D gaming environments and virtual worlds, where spatial embodiment awareness is essential for effective learning and interaction.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `deep_tree_echo_profile` directory contains all necessary files and configurations for Deep Tree Echo's operation.
- Refer to the `Deep-Tree-Echo-Persona.md` file for design principles and persona details.
- The enhanced sensory motor system requires X11 display support. Use `sensory_motor_simple.py` for optimized 3D capabilities.
- For optimal 3D environment perception, ensure that gnome-screenshot and python3-tk packages are installed.

## Enhanced Echo Value Calculation and Machine Learning Integration

The `DeepTreeEcho` class has been enhanced to calculate echo values based on content length, complexity, child echoes, node depth, sibling nodes, historical echo values, emotional states, and now **spatial context**. Machine learning models are integrated to predict echo values and analyze patterns.

### Hypergraph Memory System

The hypergraph memory system provides:

1. **Concept and relationship creation**: Store structured knowledge about entities and their relationships
2. **Memory organization**: Store and retrieve memories using hypergraph structures
3. **Pattern extraction**: Identify recurring patterns in memory structures
4. **Concept centrality analysis**: Identify key concepts in the knowledge network
5. **Path optimization**: Find optimal paths between concepts for reasoning
6. **Similarity matching**: Find similar patterns based on graph structure and semantics

### Setup for 3D Capabilities

1. Ensure you have X11 display support in your environment:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev python3-tk gnome-screenshot xvfb
```

2. Train the machine learning models:
```python
from ml_system import MLSystem

ml_system = MLSystem()
ml_system.update_models()
```

3. Test the sensory motor system with 3D capabilities:
```python
from sensory_motor_simple import SensoryMotorSystem

# Initialize the system
sensory = SensoryMotorSystem()

# Capture a test frame
frame = sensory.capture_screen()
print(f"Captured frame with shape {frame.shape if frame is not None else 'None'}")
```
